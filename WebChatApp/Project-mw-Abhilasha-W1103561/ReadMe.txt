To Professor/Grader,

                   I have done my project in WampSerevr 2.0i. Please use Wampserver in case the project doesn't run in any other server/application.
The www file contains the Project file named ChattingWeb and an index.php file which includes the basic connections
of the wampserver(php and mysql connections).
For other servers/softwares/applications just run the ChattingWeb file directly. In case
it doesn't work then copy paste the entire www file in wampserver and run the file ChattingWeb in the browser with the
address localhost/ChattingWeb
Even while running the ChattingWeb file in WampSerevr just put in the address bar localhost/ChattingWeb and you will be able
to run the project.

Thank You.

Regards,
Abhilasha Sahu.
